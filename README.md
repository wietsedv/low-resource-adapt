# Adapting Monolingual Models: Data can be Scarce when Language Similarity is High

This repository contains everything that is needed to replicate the results in the paper:

üìù [Adapting Monolingual Models: Data can be Scarce when Language Similarity is High](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02855)

## Models

The best fine-tuned models for Gronings and West Frisian are available on the HuggingFace model hub:

### Lexical layers
These models are identical to [BERTje](https://github.com/wietsedv/bertje), but with different lexical layers (`bert.embeddings.word_embeddings`).

 - ü§ó [`GroNLP/bert-base-dutch-cased`](https://huggingface.co/GroNLP/bert-base-dutch-cased) (Dutch; source language)
 - ü§ó [`GroNLP/bert-base-dutch-cased-gronings`](https://huggingface.co/GroNLP/bert-base-dutch-cased-gronings) (Gronings)
 - ü§ó [`GroNLP/bert-base-dutch-cased-frisian`](https://huggingface.co/GroNLP/bert-base-dutch-cased-frisian) (West Frisian)

### POS tagging
These models share the same fine-tuned Transformer layers + classification head, but with the retrained lexical layers from the models above.
